Our source code is in the Group26_src_code folder in the root directory. Multi Island.py and Single Island.py contain the code for training and testing the model. The comments in the code detail how it should be run.

The EA1 and EA2 folders in the Group26_src_code folder record the logs of the two algorithms trained against different enemies, respectively.

The single_island_optimisation and multi_island_optimization folders contain the trained models. The model files are named algorithm_adaptation_hyperparameters_time.txt

The images in the root directory are the images in the report, and result_visualisation.ipynb is the code that draws them.
